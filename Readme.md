🌍 Air Quality Index Prediction using Machine Learning.

I’m excited to share my latest end-to-end machine learning project, where I built a model to forecast air quality trends using real-world data from the UCI Air Quality Dataset.

The dataset includes 15 different environmental attributes such as temperature, humidity, CO, NO₂, and other gases. My goal was to predict future values and understand how these factors change over time.

What I did :

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.

Used Python, NumPy, and Pandas for data handling and visualization.

Applied the Facebook Prophet algorithm for time-series forecasting.

Forecasted future trends for multiple attributes, including relative humidity.

This project gave me a deeper understanding of data preprocessing, forecasting, and the use of AI in solving environmental challenges .
